Grab a six pack and come on over to Development Seed's garage to talk about Node.js on Monday, July 18. Node.js is awesome, and we hope this meetup will bring together developers working with it (and those who want to be) to talk code, show off their projects, and get to know each other.

We'll have a series of five minute lightning talks about anything related to Node.js. If you'd like to present, send your topic to @developmentseed or info@developmentseed.org and we'll add you to the lineup. We'll have a projector, screen, and internet, and slides and demos are welcome.

The meetup will kick off at 7:00 pm, and we'll start the lightning talks at 7:30 pm, after a round of introductions. Bring some beer/drinks to share with the group - we'll provide the fridge and some snacks. Hope to see you there!

Development Seed's office is at 1714 14th Street NW, off the alley behind 14th Street (behind Peregrine and Cork).
